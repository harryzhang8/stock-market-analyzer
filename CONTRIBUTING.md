## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analyzer.git
   cd stock-market-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

### Code Formatting
We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black stock_analyzer.py

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 stock_analyzer.py

# Type checking with mypy
mypy stock_analyzer.py
```

### Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Comment complex algorithms and business logic

Example docstring:
```python
def calculate_rsi(prices: pd.Series, period: int = 14) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Calculate Relative Strength Index (RSI) for a price series.
    
    Args:
        prices: Series of closing prices
        period: Number of periods for RSI calculation (default: 14)
        
    Returns:
        Series of RSI values (0-100 scale)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If period is less than 1
    """
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=stock_analyzer

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_indicators.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external API calls

Example test:
```python
def test_calculate_rsi_normal_case():
    """Test RSI calculation with normal price data."""
    prices = pd.Series([100, 102, 101, 103, 105, 104, 106])
    rsi = calculate_rsi(prices, period=6)
    
    assert isinstance(rsi, pd.Series)
    assert 0 <= rsi.iloc[-1] <= 100
```

## Commit Messages

```

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-indicator`
